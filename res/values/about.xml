        <item>Bartleby puts free property information from public data sources
        on a map.</item>
        <item>Unlike its namesake and the government websites it pulls from,
        Bartleby would prefer to make public data easily available.</item>
        <item>Bartleby uses Caustic scraping templates to learn where to pull
        data from, and how to utilize information it has already pulled to find
        out more.  Contribute to Caustic templates!  Your submissions
        make Bartleby even more powerful.</item>
